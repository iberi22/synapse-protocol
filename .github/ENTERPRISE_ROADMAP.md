## Contributing to Enterprise Features

**Can community contribute to enterprise features?**

**Short answer:** No, but you can influence them.

**Long answer:**
- Enterprise features stay proprietary to fund development
- BUT: If community builds similar features, we may open-source enterprise versions
- Your feedback shapes what we build

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use Synapse Protocol in my startup for free?
**A:** YES, if your entire application (including backend) is open source under AGPLv3. Otherwise, you need a commercial license.

### Q: What if I only use it internally (not distributing)?
**A:** AGPLv3 applies even to network use. If employees/users access it remotely, it's "distribution" under AGPLv3. Commercial license recommended.

### Q: Can I try before buying?
**A:** YES. Use the open source version to prototype. When you're ready to go closed-source, contact us.

### Q: Do I get the source code with a commercial license?
**A:** YES. Commercial license includes full source access + right to modify.

### Q: Can I resell Synapse Protocol?
**A:** Enterprise tier includes white-label/reseller rights. Contact us for details.

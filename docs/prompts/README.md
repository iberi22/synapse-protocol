# Session Continuation Prompts

This directory stores **temporary** session continuation prompts generated by `export-session.ps1`.

## ⚠️ Important

- Files here are **AUTO-GENERATED**, not manually created
- Files should be **DELETED after use**
- This is NOT a place for permanent documentation
- Use GitHub Issues for task tracking

## Usage

```bash
# Generate a continuation prompt
./scripts/export-session.ps1 -Summary "Working on feature X" -Topic "my-feature"

# In new chat, reference the file
#file:docs/prompts/SESSION_2025-12-02_my-feature.md
```

## Why This Exists

VS Code Chat API does **not** support:
- Auto-restoring chat history
- Pre-filling chat input
- Programmatic prompt injection

Therefore, we use `#file:` references to load context manually.
